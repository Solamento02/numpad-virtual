# Numpad-virtual
I made this cuz one friend asked to, it's an app that has the numpad numbers on it, was really hard to do. But I learned a lot from it. The app has dark mode so doesn't hurt you eyes. You can download the app from releases
# Tech
The server was made using <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org"> Node.js </a> </br>
The app was made with <a target="_blank" href="https://reactnative.dev">React Native</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://expo.dev">Expo</a>
# Server
I just realized that the server only works with node 20 version
The requirements to use the server is just install <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> after that, when you download the server folder use:
```
npm install
```
It will generate an node_modules folder and the you run the bat file(if you windows) or the bash file(if you linux) </br>
After running, you gonna do ipconfig(windows) or ifconfig(linux) to check your ip </br>

Put the IP code in the app and have fun ^^
